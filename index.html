Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.</p>
 <ul><li><strong>Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li><li><strong>Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)</strong> - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li><li><strong>Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</li><li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)</strong> - the processing is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, do not prevail.</li></ul><p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations apply to data protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant legal basis according to the Swiss Data Protection Act: </strong>If you are located in Switzerland, we process your data based on the Federal Act on Data Protection (referred to as "Swiss DPA"). Unlike the GDPR, for instance, the Swiss DPA does not generally require that a legal basis for processing personal data be stated and that the processing of personal data is conducted in good faith, lawfully and proportionately (Art. 6 para. 1 and 2 of the Swiss DPA). Furthermore, we only collect personal data for a specific purpose recognizable to the data subject and process it only in a manner compatible with this purpose (Art. 6 para. 3 of the Swiss DPA).</p>
<p><strong>Reference to the applicability of the GDPR and the Swiss DPA: </strong>These privacy policy serves both to provide information pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms used in the GDPR are applied. In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss FADP such as "processing" of "personal data", "predominant interest", and "particularly sensitive personal data", the terms used in the GDPR, namely "processing" of "personal data", as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" are used. However, the legal meaning of these terms will continue to be determined according to the Swiss FADP within its scope of application.</p>

<h2 id="m27">Security Precautions</h2><p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
<p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.</p>
<p>Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect the data of users transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we employ TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information that is transferred between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby safeguarding the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions conform to the highest security standards. When a website is secured with an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being securely and encryptedly transmitted.</p>

<h2 id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</h2><p>In the course of processing personal data, it may happen that this data is transmitted to or disclosed to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals. Recipients of this data may include service providers tasked with IT duties or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and particularly conclude relevant contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.</p>

<h2 id="m24">International data transfers</h2><p>Data Processing in Third Countries: If we transfer data to a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)), or if this occurs in the context of using third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other individuals, entities, or companies (which becomes apparent either from the postal address of the respective provider or when explicitly mentioned in the privacy policy regarding data transfer to third countries), this is always done in accordance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which has been recognized as a secure legal framework by the EU Commission's adequacy decision of July 10, 2023. Additionally, we have concluded Standard Contractual Clauses with the respective providers, which comply with the EU Commission's requirements and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.</p>
<p>This dual safeguard ensures comprehensive protection of your data: The DPF serves as the primary level of protection, while the Standard Contractual Clauses act as an additional security measure. Should any changes occur within the DPF framework, the Standard Contractual Clauses will serve as a reliable fallback option. This ensures that your data remains adequately protected even in the event of political or legal changes.</p>
<p>For individual service providers, we will inform you whether they are certified under the DPF and if Standard Contractual Clauses are in place. The list of certified companies and further information about the DPF can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.</a></p>
<p>For data transfers to other third countries, appropriate safeguards apply, particularly Standard Contractual Clauses, explicit consent, or legally required transfers. Information on third-country transfers and applicable adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by the EU Commission: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en" target="_blank">https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en.</a></p>
<p>We will inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework as part of our data protection notices.</p>
<p>Disclosure of Personal Data Abroad: In accordance with the Swiss Data Protection Act (Swiss DPA), we only disclose personal data abroad when an appropriate level of protection for the affected persons is ensured (Art. 16 Swiss DPA). If the Federal Council has not determined an adequate level of protection (list of states: <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/datenschutz/internationales/anerkennung-staaten.html" target="_blank">https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/datenschutz/internationales/anerkennung-staaten.html</a>), we implement alternative security measures.</p>
<p>For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which has been recognized as a secure legal framework by Switzerland's adequacy decision of June 7, 2024. Additionally, we have concluded Standard Data Protection Clauses with the respective providers, which have been approved by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.</p>
<p>This dual safeguard ensures comprehensive protection of your data: The DPF serves as the primary level of protection, while the Standard Data Protection Clauses act as an additional security measure. Should any changes occur within the DPF framework, the Standard Data Protection Clauses will serve as a reliable fallback option. This ensures that your data remains adequately protected even in the event of political or legal changes.</p>
<p>For individual service providers, we will inform you whether they are certified under the DPF and if Standard Data Protection Clauses are in place. The list of certified companies and further information about the DPF can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.</a></p>
<p>For data transfers to other third countries, appropriate safeguards apply, including international agreements, specific guarantees, FDPIC-approved Standard Data Protection Clauses, or internal company data protection regulations previously recognized by the FDPIC or a competent data protection authority of another country.</p>
<p>Under Art. 16 of the Swiss DPA, exceptions can be made for the disclosure of data abroad if certain conditions are met, including the consent of the affected person, contract execution, public interest, protection of life or physical integrity, publicly made data, or data from a legally provided register. Such disclosures always comply with the legal requirements.</p>
<p>We will inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework as part of our privacy notices.</p>

<h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Retention and Deletion</h2><p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal regulations as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no further legal bases for processing exist. This applies to cases where the original purpose of processing is no longer applicable or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if statutory obligations or special interests require a longer retention or archiving of the data.</p>
<p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons, or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons, must be archived accordingly.</p>

<p>In cases where multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines for a date are specified, the longest period always prevails.</p>
<p>If a period does not expressly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the time at which the termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.</p>

<h2 id="m451">Single Sign-on Authentication</h2><p>Single Sign-On" or "Single Sign-On Authentication or Logon" are procedures that allow users to log in to our online services using a user account with a provider of Single Sign-On services (e.g. a social network). The prerequisite for Single Sign-On Authentication is that users are registered with the respective Single Sign-On provider and enter the required access data in the online form provided for this purpose, or are already logged in with the Single Sign-On provider and confirm the Single Sign-On login via the button.</p>
<p>Authentication takes place directly with the respective single sign-on provider. Within the scope of such authentication, we receive a user ID with the information that the user is logged in with the respective single sign-on provider under this user ID and an ID that cannot be used for other purposes (so-called "user handle"). Whether we receive further data depends solely on the single sign-on procedure used, the data releases selected as part of authentication and also which data users have released in the privacy or other settings of the user account with the single sign-on provider. Depending on the single sign-on provider and the user's choice, there can be different data, usually the e-mail address and the user name.

<p>Users are requested to note that their data stored with us can be automatically compared with their user account with the single sign-on provider, but this is not always possible or actual.

<h2 id="m2555">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2><p>We use artificial intelligence (AI), which involves the processing of personal data. The specific purposes and our interest in using AI are mentioned below. According to the term "AI system" as defined in Article 3 No. 1 of the AI Regulation, we understand AI to be a machine-based system designed for varying degrees of autonomous operation, capable of adaptation after deployment, and producing outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.</p>
<p>Our AI systems are used in strict compliance with legal requirements. These include both specific regulations for artificial intelligence and data protection requirements. In particular, we adhere to the principles of lawfulness, transparency, fairness, human oversight, purpose limitation, data minimisation, integrity and confidentiality. We ensure that the processing of personal data is always based on a legal foundation. This may either be the consent of the data subjects or a statutory permission.</p>
<p>When using external AI systems, we carefully select their providers (hereinafter referred to as "AI providers"). In accordance with our legal obligations, we ensure that the AI providers comply with applicable provisions. We also observe our duties when using or operating the acquired AI services. The processing of personal data by us and the AI providers is carried out exclusively on the basis of consent or legal authorisation. We place particular emphasis on transparency, fairness and maintaining human oversight over AI-supported decision-making processes.</p>
<p>To protect processed data, we implement appropriate and robust technical as well as organisational measures. These ensure the integrity and confidentiality of processed data and minimise potential risks. Through regular reviews of AI providers and their services, we ensure ongoing compliance with current legal and ethical standards.</p>

<h2 id="m29">Cloud Services</h2><p>We use Internet-accessible software services (so-called "cloud services", also referred to as "Software as a Service") provided on the servers of its providers for the storage and management of content (e.g. document storage and management, exchange of documents, content and information with certain recipients or publication of content and information).</p>
<p>Within this framework, personal data may be processed and stored on the provider's servers insofar as this data is part of communication processes with us or is otherwise processed by us in accordance with this privacy policy.

<h2 id="m263">Web Analysis, Monitoring and Optimization</h2><p>Web analytics (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the visitor flows of our online services and may include pseudonymous values related to visitor behavior, interests, or demographic information such as age or gender. Through reach analysis, we can, for example, identify when our online services or their functions and content are most frequently used or likely to encourage repeat visits. It also enables us to determine which areas need optimization.</p>
<p>In addition to web analytics, we may also use testing procedures to test and optimize different versions of our online services or their components.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified below, profiles (i.e., data combined from a usage process) may be created for these purposes, and information can be stored in and later retrieved from a browser or device. The data collected includes, in particular, visited websites and elements used on them, as well as technical information such as the browser used, the computer system, and information about usage times. If users have given consent to the collection of their location data to us or to the providers of the services we use, the processing of location data is also possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, users' IP addresses are stored. However, we use an IP masking process (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear user data (such as email addresses or names) is stored as part of web analytics, A/B testing, or optimization. Instead, pseudonyms are used. This means that neither we nor the providers of the software used know the actual identity of the users, only the information stored in their profiles for the respective procedures.</p>
<p>Legal basis information: If we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers, the legal basis for data processing is consent. Otherwise, user data is processed based on our legitimate interests (i.e., our interest in efficient, economic, and user-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to point out the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>

This identification number does not contain any unique data, such as names or email addresses. It is used to assign analysis information to an end device in order to recognize which content users have accessed within one or various usage processes, which search terms they have used, have accessed again or have interacted with our online services. Likewise, the time of use and its duration are stored, as well as the sources of users referring to our online services and technical aspects of their end devices and browsers. <br>In the process, pseudonymous profiles of users are created with information from the use of various devices, and cookies may be used. Google Analytics does not log or store individual IP addresses. Analytics does provide coarse geo-location data by deriving the following metadata from IP addresses: City (and the derived latitude, and longitude of the city), Continent, Country, Region, Subcontinent (and ID-based counterparts). For EU-based traffic, IP-address data is used solely for geo-location data derivation before being immediately discarded. It is not logged, accessible, or used for any additional use cases. When Analytics collects measurement data, all IP lookups are performed on EU-based servers before forwarding traffic to Analytics servers for processing; <strong>Service provider</strong>: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <span class=""><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en/about/analytics/" target="_blank">https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en/about/analytics/</a>; <strong>Security measures:</strong> IP Masking (Pseudonymization of the IP address); <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>; <strong>Data Processing Agreement:</strong> <a href="https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/" target="_blank">https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/</a>; <strong>Basis for third-country transfers:</strong> EEA - Data Privacy Framework (DPF), Standard Contractual Clauses (<a href="https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms" target="_blank">https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms</a>), Switzerland - Data Privacy Framework (DPF), Standard Contractual Clauses ( <a href="https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms" target="_blank">https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms</a>); <strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Opt-Out-Plugin: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>, Settings for the Display of Advertisements: <a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/personalizationoff" target="_blank">https://myadcenter.google.com/personalizationoff</a>. <strong>Further Information:</strong> <a href="https://business.safety.google/adsservices/" target="_blank">https://business.safety.google/adsservices/</a> (Types of processing and data processed).</li></ul>
<h2 id="m264">Online Marketing</h2><p>We process personal data for the purposes of online marketing, which may include in particular the marketing of advertising space or the display of advertising and other content (collectively referred to as "Content") based on the potential interests of users and the measurement of their effectiveness. </p>
<p>For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedure is used by which the relevant user information for the display of the aforementioned content is stored. This information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, communication partners and technical information such as the browser used, computer system used and information on usage times and used functions. If users have consented to the collection of their sideline data, these can also be processed.</p>
<p>The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use provided IP masking procedures (i.e. pseudonymisation by shortening the IP address) to ensure the protection of the user's by using a pseudonym. In general, within the framework of the online marketing process, no clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is secured, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of online marketing procedures, do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles.</p>
<p>The information in the profiles is usually stored in the cookies or similar memorizing procedures. These cookies can later, generally also on other websites that use the same online marketing technology, be read and analyzed for purposes of content display, as well as supplemented with other data and stored on the server of the online marketing technology provider.</p>
<p>Exceptionally, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case, for example, if the users are members of a social network whose online marketing technology we use and the network links the profiles of the users in the aforementioned data. Please note that users may enter into additional agreements with the social network providers or other service providers, e.g. by consenting as part of a registration process.</p>
<p>As a matter of principle, we only gain access to summarised information about the performance of our advertisements. However, within the framework of so-called conversion measurement, we can check which of our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion, i.e. to the conclusion of a contract with us. The conversion measurement is used alone for the performance analysis of our marketing activities.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, we kindly ask you to consider that cookies used will be stored for a period of two years.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on revocation and objection:</strong></p>
<p>We refer to the privacy policies of the respective service providers and the possibilities for objection (so-called "opt-out"). If no explicit opt-out option has been specified, it is possible to deactivate cookies in the settings of your browser. However, this may restrict the functions of our online offer. We therefore recommend the following additional opt-out options, which are offered collectively for each area: </p>

<h2 id="m136">Profiles in Social Networks (Social Media)</h2><p>We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may entail risks for users, e.g. by making it more difficult to enforce users' rights.</p>
<p>In addition, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behaviour and the associated interests of users. The user profiles can then be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks which are presumed to correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user's computer, in which the user's usage behaviour and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective networks or will become members later on).</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the respective processing operations and the opt-out options, please refer to the respective data protection declarations and information provided by the providers of the respective networks.</p>
<p>Also in the case of requests for information and the exercise of rights of data subjects, we point out that these can be most effectively pursued with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. If you still need help, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<h2 id="m328">Plugins and embedded functions and content</h2><p>Within our online services, we integrate functional and content elements that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may, for example, be graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "Content").</p>
<p>The integration always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of these contents or functions. We strive to use only those contents, whose respective offerers use the IP address only for the distribution of the contents. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit times and other information about the use of our website, as well as may be linked to such information from other sources.</p>

<h2 id="m42">Terminology and Definitions</h2><p>In this section, you will find an overview of the terminology used in this privacy policy. Where the terminology is legally defined, their legal definitions apply. The following explanations, however, are primarily intended to aid understanding.</p>
 <ul class="glossary"><li><strong>Affiliate Tracking:</strong> Custom Audiences refers to the process of determining target groups for advertising purposes, e.g. the display of advertisements. For example, a user's interest in certain products or topics on the Internet may be used to conclude that the user is interested in advertisements for similar products or the online store in which the user viewed the products. "Lookalike Audiences" is the term used to describe content that is viewed as suitable by users whose profiles or interests presumably correspond to the users for whom the profiles were created. For the purposes of creating custom audiences and lookalike audiences, cookies and web beacons are typically used. </li><li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> The purpose of processing data through Artificial Intelligence (AI) includes the automated analysis and processing of user data to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve the efficiency and quality of our services. This involves the collection, cleansing, and structuring of data, training and applying AI models, as well as the continuous review and optimisation of results, and is carried out exclusively with users' consent or based on legal authorisation grounds. </li><li><strong>Contact data:</strong> Contact details are essential information that enables communication with individuals or organizations. They include, among others, phone numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses, as well as means of communication like social media handles and instant messaging identifiers. </li><li><strong>Content data:</strong> Content data comprise information generated in the process of creating, editing, and publishing content of all types. This category of data may include texts, images, videos, audio files, and other multimedia content published across various platforms and media. Content data are not limited to the content itself but also include metadata providing information about the content, such as tags, descriptions, authorship details, and publication dates. </li><li><strong>Contract data:</strong> Contract data are specific details pertaining to the formalisation of an agreement between two or more parties. They document the terms under which services or products are provided, exchanged, or sold. This category of data is essential for managing and fulfilling contractual obligations and includes both the identification of the contracting parties and the specific terms and conditions of the agreement. Contract data may encompass the start and end dates of the contract, the nature of the agreed-upon services or products, pricing arrangements, payment terms, termination rights, extension options, and special conditions or clauses. They serve as the legal foundation for the relationship between the parties and are crucial for clarifying rights and duties, enforcing claims, and resolving disputes. </li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> "Controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. </li><li><strong>Employees:</strong> As employees, individuals are those who are engaged in an employment relationship, whether as staff, employees, or in similar positions. Employment refers to a legal relationship between an employer and an employee, established through an employment contract or agreement. It entails the obligation of the employer to pay the employee remuneration while the employee performs their work. The employment relationship encompasses various stages, including establishment, where the employment contract is concluded, execution, where the employee carries out their work activities, and termination, when the employment relationship ends, whether through termination, mutual agreement, or otherwise. Employee data encompasses all information pertaining to these individuals within the context of their employment. This includes aspects such as personal identification details, identification numbers, salary and banking information, working hours, holiday entitlements, health data, and performance assessments. </li><li><strong>Inventory data:</strong> Inventory data encompass essential information required for the identification and management of contractual partners, user accounts, profiles, and similar assignments. These data may include, among others, personal and demographic details such as names, contact information (addresses, phone numbers, email addresses), birth dates, and specific identifiers (user IDs). Inventory data form the foundation for any formal interaction between individuals and services, facilities, or systems, by enabling unique assignment and communication. </li><li><strong>Log data:</strong> Protocol data, or log data, refer to information regarding events or activities that have been logged within a system or network. These data typically include details such as timestamps, IP addresses, user actions, error messages, and other specifics about the usage or operation of a system. Protocol data is often used for analyzing system issues, monitoring security, or generating performance reports. </li><li><strong>Meta, communication and process data:</strong> Meta-, communication, and procedural data are categories that contain information about how data is processed, transmitted, and managed. Meta-data, also known as data about data, include information that describes the context, origin, and structure of other data. They can include details about file size, creation date, the author of a document, and modification histories. Communication data capture the exchange of information between users across various channels, such as email traffic, call logs, messages in social networks, and chat histories, including the involved parties, timestamps, and transmission paths. Procedural data describe the processes and operations within systems or organisations, including workflow documentations, logs of transactions and activities, and audit logs used for tracking and verifying procedures. </li><li><strong>Payment Data:</strong> Payment data comprise all information necessary for processing payment transactions between buyers and sellers. This data is crucial for e-commerce, online banking, and any other form of financial transaction. It includes details such as credit card numbers, bank account information, payment amounts, transaction dates, verification numbers, and billing information. Payment data may also contain information on payment status, chargebacks, authorizations, and fees. </li><li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. </li><li><strong>Processing:</strong> The term "processing" covers a wide range and practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure. </li><li><strong>Profiles with user-related information:</strong> The processing of "profiles with user-related information", or "profiles" for short, includes any kind of automated processing of personal data that consists of using these personal data to analyse, evaluate or predict certain personal aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, this may include different information concerning demographics, behaviour and interests, such as interaction with websites and their content, etc.) (e.g. interests in certain content or products, click behaviour on a website or location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for profiling purposes. </li><li><strong>Targeting:</strong> "Tracking" is the term used when the behaviour of users can be traced across several websites. As a rule, behavior and interest information with regard to the websites used is stored in cookies or on the servers of the tracking technology providers (so-called profiling). This information can then be used, for example, to display advertisements to users presumably corresponding to their interests. </li><li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Usage data refer to information that captures how users interact with digital products, services, or platforms. These data encompass a wide range of information that demonstrates how users utilise applications, which features they prefer, how long they spend on specific pages, and through what paths they navigate an application. Usage data can also include the frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP addresses, device information, and location data. They are particularly valuable for analysing user behaviour, optimising user experiences, personalising content, and improving products or services. Furthermore, usage data play a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and potential problem areas within digital offerings </li><li><strong>Web Analytics:</strong> Web Analytics serves the evaluation of visitor traffic of online services and can determine their behavior or interests in certain information, such as content of websites. With the help of web analytics, website owners, for example, can recognize at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This enables them, for example, to better adapt the content of their websites to the needs of their visitors. For the purposes of web analytics , pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are often used to recognize returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an online service. </li></ul>
